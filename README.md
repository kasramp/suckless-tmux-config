# Suckless Tmux config

A suckless, minimalistic Tmux config with Vim key bindings.

## Rationale

There are countless Tmux configs all over the internet. However, they are mostly bloated, use plugins, and difficult to deploy to servers.

Suckless Tmux config is created based on the **Less is more** principle with the objective of simplicity and usability. It's flavored with Vim key bindings
and designed to be understandable, small, and easily deployable to any server without any plugins or voodoo work while being aesthetically pleasing.
